Wall Art
========

This is a CircuitPython port of an art piece I have
hanging in the wall of my office, with
pixels crammed into a cardboard box.

This port is running on a 1x1 stick of wood,
with tissue paper around it.

It doesn't do anything.
It just looks interesting.

Most people, when they see it,
form different ideas about what it's displaying.
That's cool.
