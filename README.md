Wall Art
========

This is a CircuitPython port of an art piece I have
hanging in the wall of my office, with
pixels crammed into a cardboard box.

This port is running on a 1x1 stick of wood,
with tissue paper around it.

It doesn't display anything significant.
The idea is to have something to look at if you're idle,
without it being a distraction from more pressing issues.
If you're familiar with the album "music for airports",
it's that.

Most people, after watching it for a bit,
form different ideas about what it's displaying.
That's cool.


History
-------

I was trying to make pixels fade in and out,
and got the math wrong.
But what I wound up with looked more interesting
than what I was trying to make,
so I kept it.
