Wall Art
========

This an art piece I have
hanging in the wall of my house, with
pixels crammed into a cardboard box.

It doesn't display anything significant.
The idea is to have something to look at if you're idle,
without it being a distraction from more pressing issues.
If you're familiar with the album "music for airports",
it's that.

Most people, after watching it for a bit,
form different ideas about what it's displaying.
That's cool.


Philosophy
----------

I was trying to make pixels fade in and out,
and got the math wrong.
But what I wound up with looked more interesting
than what I was trying to make,
so I kept it.

After many trips to Meow Wolf's House of Eternal Return,
I realized that the presentation of the piece
is more important
than how complicated the algorithm is.

It's hard to encapsulate in a git repository,
but if you want to make NeoPixel art,
think hard about what the end result should look like.
It's not enough to make a cool light show;
it has to make people wonder "what is that for?"
